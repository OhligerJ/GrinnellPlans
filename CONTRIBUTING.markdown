## Contributing code ##
This project is a ground-up rewrite of Plans in Ruby on Rails.
Goal: replicate almost all existing Plans functionality in Rails.

If you want to make changes to the PHP codebase that's currently in production, that's [here](https://code.google.com/p/grinnellplans/)

**No new features until launch.**
Sorry.
Excited to build something new in Rails?
Help us get to launch quicker so that you can get started on your great new idea.

   This way you can submit a pull request once you've fixed something (if you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, [ask for help](#how-to-get-help)!)
2. Follow the README to get the project set up.
   If steps are missing or something doesn't work, [ask for help](#how-to-get-help)!
3. Try picking one or two issues from the list of [bite-sized tasks](https://github.com/annaswims/GrinnellPlans/labels/bite%20sized).
   These are small projects that will help you get comfortable with the application and let you experience the contribution process.
4. If you're feeling good after that, move up to the [extra credit](https://github.com/annaswims/GrinnellPlans/labels/extra%20credit).
5. By now you probably have more ideas of things that need fixing. If not, [ask!](#how-to-get-help)

### How to get help ###

Please don't hesitate to ask for help!
We love helping people who are newer to Rails or web development.
If something seems broken, it probably is -- ask early, ask often.

 * You can ask questions on [the development mailing list](listserv).
   This list covers all aspects of Plans development and has a diverse audience, which can be helpful.
 * If you're stuck on something in particular or don't want to broadcast your question to everyone, you can ask [youngian] personally.
   [Email me](mailto:ian@iangreenleaf.com) and we'll continue the conversation by email or IM.



## Contributing other things ##

Due to the current rewrite status of this project, we don't need much non-code contribution at the moment.
Plans as a whole always needs more help, though, so don't give up!
Check with the admins, or ask on the [development mailing list](listserv).
